[{"content":"Introduction In a large, distributed company, aligning teams is challenging. With different objectives, inefficiencies and conflicts can arise. OKRs (Objectives and Key Results), KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), and metrics help guide decisions, but they can also create competition, leading to unintended prioritization due to lack of alignment.\nConsider this scenario: Sales teams push for rapid feature releases to close deals, but Engineering prioritizes reducing technical debt. Without a structured decision-making framework, these conflicts can lead to disengagement, frustration, and inefficiencies.\nOKRs define ambitious goals with measurable outcomes, ensuring alignment on high-level objectives. KPIs track ongoing performance in key areas, providing insight into operational success. Metrics offer data-driven insights but can lead to siloed thinking if not contextualized properly. Used effectively, these tools create clarity and drive better decisions. However, when misaligned, they can generate conflicting priorities, leading to a cycle of accidental decision-making\nCommon Priority Conflicts Teams often optimize for their own KPIs, sometimes at the expense of company-wide goals. Some classics include:\nConflict Description Consequence Sales vs. Product Sales pushes for fast releases to close deals, while Product slows down to ensure quality Customer churn due to bugs or unmet expectations Engineering vs. Marketing Engineers focus on reducing technical debt, while Marketing demands rapid feature rollouts Fragile systems and potential outages Regional vs. Global Teams Local teams prioritize market-specific needs, while headquarters pushes for standardization Resistance, inefficiencies, or market misalignment Customer Support vs. Product Development Support wants to minimize response times, while new product features increase customer inquiries Short-term bottlenecks in support Legal \u0026amp; Compliance vs. Business Development Compliance enforces strict regulations, potentially delaying product launches, while business teams push for speed-to-market Missed competitive opportunities or compliance risks Without clear alignment, decisions default to the loudest voice rather than strategic intent. Avoiding tough decisions leads to unintended prioritization, where trade-offs are neither understood nor managed. The consequence is team disengagement and wasted effort.\nResolving Conflicts Clarity on priorities and explicit trade-offs foster psychological safety, ensuring teams trust the process and collaborate effectively. Shared metrics and data-driven decisions reduce ambiguity and create alignment.\n1. Collect and Analyze Data Use KPIs, OKRs, and performance metrics to understand interactions between priorities. Ensure visibility into team-level goals and company-wide objectives, making contributions to the value chains explicit and monitorable. 2. Apply a Decision-Making Framework Use an Organizational Decision Record (ODR) to document key decisions transparently. Define a clear conflict-resolution process when priorities clash. Make trade-offs explicit to prevent unintended prioritization. 3. Regularly Review and Communicate Priorities Establish a clear hierarchy of priorities. Hold routine alignment meetings to reassess and adjust as needed. Transparently communicate decisions and trade-offs, highlighting the reasoning behind each decision. Reinforce intentional, conscious decision-making to avoid reactive prioritization. Recognizing and explaining decisions openly increases team confidence and engagement, strengthening trust in leadership and the decision-making process. Conflict Resolution Flowchart\nConclusion Aligning priorities in a large company requires clear communication and intentional decisions. While OKRs, KPIs, and metrics are essential, they can lead to misalignment if used in isolation. By leveraging structured decision-making frameworks and regularly reviewing priorities, companies can make deliberate, strategic choices rather than reactive ones.\nThe Organizational Decision Record (ODR) plays a crucial role in ensuring key decisions are documented, tracked, and refined over time. The goal isn’t to eliminate competing priorities but to consciously manage them, ensuring the company moves forward as a whole. Conscious decision-making not only resolves conflicts effectively but also builds a culture of trust and engagement, where teams feel empowered and aligned with leadership.\n","permalink":"https://migibert.github.io/posts/team-performance/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a large, distributed company, aligning teams is challenging.

This idea comes from the Theory of Constraints. The basic premise is simple: identify the biggest bottleneck, fix it, and the entire system improves.\nIn gardening, constraints can take many forms: light, temperature, water availability, soil quality, space, and even the timing of tasks. Different gardening methods have evolved to tackle these challenges, each aiming to optimize the flow of resources and reduce inefficiencies. Let’s take a closer look at how some popular approaches address key constraints.\nCommon Constraints in Gardening Light Plants need sunlight for photosynthesis, but not every garden gets full sun. Shade from trees, buildings, or even taller plants can limit growth. Some methods aim to maximize light exposure by careful plant placement or artificial lighting.\nTemperature Every plant has a preferred temperature range. Extreme heat can stress plants, while cold snaps can stunt or kill them. Season extension techniques, such as greenhouses or cold frames, help mitigate this limitation.\nWater Too little water, and plants wither. Too much, and roots rot. Smart irrigation systems, water-retaining soil amendments, and hydroponics help maintain the right balance.\nNutrients Plants need specific nutrients in the right amounts. Poor soil can be a major constraint, but composting, fertilization, and crop rotation help replenish essential elements.\nSpace \u0026amp; Competition Overcrowding leads to competition for light, water, and nutrients. Some methods, like square foot gardening and vertical farming, maximize space efficiency.\nTiming \u0026amp; Concurrency Gardens are living systems where multiple plants grow, flower, and fruit at different times. Poor planning can lead to empty beds or overcrowded harvest periods. Succession planting and companion planting help balance these cycles.\nHow Different Gardening Methods Address Constraints Raised Bed Gardening: Fixing Soil \u0026amp; Drainage Issues Raised beds create a controlled growing environment with improved drainage and soil quality. They also warm up faster in the spring, extending the growing season.\nPermaculture: Mimicking Natural Ecosystems Permaculture focuses on designing a self-sustaining system by integrating plants, animals, and soil health. This approach reduces external inputs and optimizes natural cycles, tackling multiple constraints at once.\nHydroponics \u0026amp; Aquaponics: Eliminating Soil as a Limitation By growing plants in a nutrient-rich water solution, hydroponics removes soil quality as a constraint. Aquaponics goes a step further by incorporating fish, creating a closed-loop nutrient system.\nSquare Foot Gardening: Maximizing Space This method organizes plants into small, efficient sections, ensuring each one gets adequate resources without wasted space.\nSuccession Planting: Smoothing Out Timing Constraints By staggering plantings, succession planting ensures a steady harvest and prevents gaps in productivity.\nCompanion Planting: Reducing Competition \u0026amp; Enhancing Growth Certain plants grow better together. For example, legumes fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting neighboring plants, while marigolds can deter pests.\nBonsai: Creating Constraints to Shape Growth Bonsai is a unique example of deliberately introducing constraints to achieve a desired result. By limiting root space, controlling water and nutrients, and carefully pruning branches, bonsai growers shape trees into miniature, artistic forms. In this case, constraints are not obstacles to be removed but tools used to refine and guide the growth process.\nKaresansui (Zen Gardens): Using Constraints for Aesthetic Flow Japanese karesansui, or Zen gardens, take an entirely different approach by deliberately reducing plant life and focusing on rocks, sand, and minimal greenery. The constraints of limited plant materials and space create a meditative, harmonious design that flows despite its simplicity. This is an example of how constraints can be leveraged for aesthetic rather than productive purposes.\nDesert Farming Techniques: Overcoming Extreme Environmental Limits In arid regions, desert farming has evolved to work with severe water limitations. Techniques like drip irrigation, shade structures, and water-harvesting earthworks help optimize scarce resources, proving that even extreme constraints can be managed through innovative design.\nThe Dynamic Nature of Gardening Systems A garden is not a static environment; it is a dynamic system where each change can have ripple effects on other variables. For example:\nIncreasing water availability can improve plant health but may also wash away nutrients, requiring additional soil amendments. Reducing plant spacing can maximize space efficiency but might increase competition for light and nutrients, requiring better planning or companion planting strategies. Introducing pollinator-friendly plants might increase fruit yields but could also attract more pests, necessitating integrated pest management. By understanding these interdependencies, gardeners can fine-tune their approach rather than simply removing constraints in isolation. The most productive gardens don’t just add more inputs, they optimize the balance and flow of resources.\nOptimizing the Flow of a Garden System Gardening is an ongoing process of identifying and addressing constraints. Successful approaches tend to:\nEliminate bottlenecks (e.g., hydroponics removes soil limitations). Increase capacity where needed (e.g., raised beds improve drainage and soil quality). Improve synchronization (e.g., succession planting spreads out harvest times). Leverage constraints creatively (e.g., bonsai and karesansui use limitations as artistic elements). By thinking of a garden as a dynamic system and applying the Theory of Constraints, gardeners can create more resilient and productive environments. Whether through small backyard tweaks or large-scale innovations, every method aims to improve flow, reduce inefficiencies, and make the most of available resources.\n","permalink":"https://migibert.github.io/posts/gardening-toc/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGardening is a system, just like any other, and every system has a limiting factor: something that holds it back from reaching its full potential.

The theory of constraints teaches us that every system has a bottleneck, a limiting factor that determines the overall outcome. In cooking, we typically think of time, ingredients, or technique as constraints, but let\u0026rsquo;s explore deeper, unconventional constraints that shape the way we prepare and experience food.\nConstraint #1: The Softness Paradox One of the most fundamental constraints in cooking is tenderness. Meat, fish, and vegetables each have their own “breaking points.” Overcook a fish fillet, and it disintegrates; undercook a brisket, and it\u0026rsquo;s unchewable. The secret to optimizing tenderness lies in understanding how to manipulate this constraint.\nTake sous vide cooking: it removes the harsh fluctuations of heat and applies a gentle, time-driven constraint to break down collagen in meat while preserving moisture. Similarly, in Japanese tempura, the constraint is the batter thickness. A thicker coat retains moisture but can become soggy. A thinner coat crisps perfectly but risks dryness. The ideal solution? An ice-cold batter that delays gluten activation, controlling crispness through temperature rather than thickness.\nConstraint #2: The Spice Bottleneck Spices are another constraint that governs a dish. Adding all spices at once might seem efficient, but this overloads the flavor extraction process, preventing individual notes from developing fully. Instead, understanding how spices release their essence under different conditions is key.\nIndian tadka (tempering) is a prime example. Whole spices like mustard seeds, cumin, and cloves are added at different times in hot oil. This staggered release enhances depth, preventing a single overpowering note from dominating the dish. Similarly, in Chinese tea-smoked duck, the constraint is the balance of smoke and tea tannins, which is controlled not just by the smoking time, but by the sequence in which tea leaves, rice, and sugar interact with the heat.\nConstraint #3: The Heat Paradox Heat is a non-negotiable constraint in cooking, but what’s fascinating is how cultures around the world have developed diametrically opposite strategies to work with it.\nConsider French confit vs. Chinese wok hei. Duck confit thrives in a “low and slow” environment, where the constraint is fat rendering at a temperature that allows collagen to break down without toughening the meat. On the other hand, wok hei, the elusive smoky aroma in Cantonese stir-fry, can only be achieved by pushing the constraint to the opposite extreme: blasting heat at the highest possible level to char proteins and caramelize sugars in seconds.\nBoth techniques work with the same constraint (heat) but take radically different approaches to optimize flavor and texture.\nConstraint #4: The Emotional Constraint Not all constraints are physical. The most overlooked constraint in cooking is time pressure, how stress affects the outcome of a meal. Japanese omakase chefs train to work in a high-pressure environment where precision and minimal movements allow them to deliver impeccable sushi under intense scrutiny. Contrast this with the slow, communal cooking of Ethiopian injera, where fermentation requires patience, and the entire dining experience is an unhurried social ritual.\nOur emotional state while cooking shapes the final dish. A rushed cook may chop unevenly, over-season, or neglect resting times, introducing failure modes that affect the final result. Sometimes, the best way to optimize a meal isn\u0026rsquo;t by tweaking the ingredients or heat, but by changing the mindset of the cook.\nCooking as a Dynamic System Cooking is not a static process: it is an ever-changing system where constraints interact and influence each other. The level of heat affects spice release; the tenderness of meat dictates the cooking technique; time pressure influences precision. A single adjustment in one constraint can shift the entire balance of a dish. For example, increasing the searing temperature to develop a crust on a steak may require reducing overall cooking time to maintain a juicy interior. Similarly, adjusting the spice levels in a stew may call for a change in cooking duration to allow flavors to fully develop. Understanding these interdependencies is what separates intuitive cooks from those merely following a recipe.\nConclusion: Cooking as a Flow Optimization Problem Seeing cooking through the lens of the theory of constraints allows us to appreciate it as an optimization problem. The best chefs aren’t just great at technique; they deeply understand which constraints matter most for each dish and how to manipulate them to achieve the desired outcome. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s controlling the sequence of spice infusion, mastering the paradox of heat, or managing the emotional constraint of cooking under pressure, success in the kitchen is about finding and exploiting the bottleneck.\nNext time you\u0026rsquo;re in the kitchen, ask yourself: What is the real constraint in this dish? Identifying it may just unlock the secret to a better meal.\n","permalink":"https://migibert.github.io/posts/cooking-toc/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIntroduction\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCooking is a system governed by constraints.

Observing BJJ through the lens of the Theory of Constraints, a concept from systems management, offers a perspective on how physical and biomechanical limitations shape the practice. These constraints arise due to an opponent’s actions or a practitioner\u0026rsquo;s own movements, influencing the flow of engagement on the mat.\nThe Body as a System A BJJ practitioner’s body can be viewed as a dynamic system composed of multiple interconnected elements: joints, muscles, limbs, and core stability. Like any system, the body has constraints that dictate its range of motion, strength distribution, and balance. Success in BJJ appears to depend on how well a practitioner manages their own constraints while navigating those imposed by their opponent.\nFor instance, during a guard pass, a practitioner’s ability to move freely is influenced by the constraints created by their opponent’s guard. If the opponent frames against their shoulders, locks their hips in place with grips, or uses their legs to manage distance, these constraints limit movement and require adaptations. Recognizing these bottlenecks in movement provides insight into the adjustments needed for progression.\nConstraints Imposed by the Opponent In a live BJJ exchange, both practitioners continuously apply constraints to each other. These constraints manifest in various ways, such as positional control, weight distribution, or strategic grips. Each constraint placed on an opponent alters their movement and decision-making, shaping the flow of the match.\nFor example, when a cross-face is applied from side control, the opponent’s ability to turn into the attacker is restricted. This constraint may lead to predictable reactions—perhaps framing to relieve pressure or attempting an underhook—both of which could create opportunities for further action.\nThe opponent’s system is always adapting to the imposed constraints. Observing how these constraints influence movement and decision-making may offer a better understanding of how positions and transitions develop over time.\nConstraints Are a Two-Way Street While applying a constraint limits an opponent, it also introduces limitations for the person applying it. Every action in BJJ has a consequence—if one practitioner commits both hands to controlling an opponent’s arm, they may lose the ability to base or post in case of a sweep attempt. If someone establishes a strong leg entanglement for a heel hook, their own mobility may become restricted, potentially exposing them to counterattacks.\nA classic example is the closed guard. The guard player applies a constraint by locking their legs around their opponent’s hips, limiting their ability to stand or move freely. However, this also restricts the guard player’s mobility and forces them to rely on upper-body control and angles to execute attacks. Recognizing this trade-off offers an interesting perspective on how constraints influence decision-making.\nObserving Constraints in Practice Examining BJJ through the Theory of Constraints presents an intriguing way to analyze positional control, leverage, and adaptability. Some potential areas of focus include:\nIdentifying Key Constraints: Understanding which constraints are most limiting in a given exchange can provide insight into positional dynamics. Is an opponent’s frame preventing movement? Is their posture allowing them to escape?\nNoticing Patterns: Since constraints influence movement, observing how they create predictable reactions may reveal strategic openings. If an opponent relies heavily on framing, breaking the frame might significantly alter the situation.\nRecognizing Trade-offs: Every constraint imposed also affects the person applying it. Reflecting on potential vulnerabilities could lead to better decision-making in different scenarios.\nAdapting Dynamically: Since every constraint creates a reaction, the ability to readjust and shift based on an opponent’s response seems to be an important part of BJJ.\nConclusion Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu involves a constant interplay of constraints. Viewing it through the Theory of Constraints offers a different way to think about positional control, leverage, and adaptation. Whether examining guard passing, escapes, or submissions, constraints influence every exchange. Observing how these limitations shape movement and decision-making may provide a valuable perspective on the art of BJJ.\n","permalink":"https://migibert.github.io/posts/bjj-toc/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is often described as a game of human chess, where strategy, leverage, and technique play a crucial role.

However, as decision complexity increases, manually evaluating all possible options becomes impractical. Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) offer a way to systematically optimize decision-making by leveraging constraint-solving algorithms.\nIn this article, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore how to convert an ODR decision into a CSP problem and implement it using Timefold, an open-source optimization engine.\nUnderstanding the Decision-Making Problem Let\u0026rsquo;s take the example from the original ODR article:\nContext Team A lacks a Product Owner (PO). Team B has a PO. Hiring externally takes time. Constraints Each team must have a PO. No PO can be assigned to more than one team. Hiring externally has a higher cost. Considered Options Fire the whole team (unrealistic but considered). Hire an external PO. Open a backfill position. Hire a contractor. Transfer an internal PO. Transfer John Doe from Team A. Transfer Jane Doe from Team B. Rather than manually scoring these options, we can formulate this as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) and solve it with Timefold.\nDefining the CSP Model Step 1: Define Decision Variables The decision variables represent the possible assignments of a PO to Team A:\npoAssignment can take values {External, John Doe, Jane Doe, None}. Step 2: Define Constraints Using Timefold\u0026rsquo;s constraint engine, we encode:\nEach team must have a PO → A valid solution must assign a PO to Team A. No PO can be assigned twice → If Jane Doe is assigned to Team A, she cannot remain in Team B. Hiring cost minimization → Assigning an internal PO is preferred over hiring externally. Step 3: Define an Optimization Function The objective is to minimize hiring cost while ensuring every team has a PO.\nImplementing the CSP Model with Timefold @PlanningEntity public class Team { private String name; @PlanningVariable(valueRangeProviderRefs = \u0026#34;poRange\u0026#34;) private ProductOwner assignedPO; } @PlanningSolution public class ODRSolution { @PlanningEntityCollectionProperty private List\u0026lt;Team\u0026gt; teams; @ValueRangeProvider(id = \u0026#34;poRange\u0026#34;) public List\u0026lt;ProductOwner\u0026gt; getAvailablePOs() { return List.of(new ProductOwner(\u0026#34;John Doe\u0026#34;), new ProductOwner(\u0026#34;Jane Doe\u0026#34;), new ProductOwner(\u0026#34;External\u0026#34;, true)); } } public class ODRConstraintProvider implements ConstraintProvider { @Override public Constraint[] defineConstraints(ConstraintFactory factory) { return new Constraint[] { factory.forEach(Team.class) .filter(team -\u0026gt; team.getAssignedPO() == null) .penalize(\u0026#34;Each team must have a PO\u0026#34;, HardSoftScore.ONE_HARD), factory.forEachUniquePair(Team.class, Joiners.equal(Team::getAssignedPO)) .penalize(\u0026#34;No PO duplication\u0026#34;, HardSoftScore.ONE_HARD), factory.forEach(Team.class) .filter(team -\u0026gt; team.getAssignedPO() != null \u0026amp;\u0026amp; team.getAssignedPO().isExternal()) .penalize(\u0026#34;Minimize external hiring cost\u0026#34;, HardSoftScore.ONE_SOFT) }; } } Running the Solver SolverFactory\u0026lt;ODRSolution\u0026gt; solverFactory = SolverFactory.create(new SolverConfig() .withSolutionClass(ODRSolution.class) .withEntityClasses(Team.class) .withConstraintProviderClass(ODRConstraintProvider.class) .withTerminationSpentLimit(Duration.ofSeconds(10))); Solver\u0026lt;ODRSolution\u0026gt; solver = solverFactory.buildSolver(); ODRSolution bestSolution = solver.solve(initialSolution); Conclusion By formulating ODR decisions as a CSP, we can leverage constraint solvers like Timefold to automate optimal decision-making.\nThis approach scales efficiently, making it especially useful for complex organizational decisions.

It has many positive side-effects: documentation, clarification, explanation\u0026hellip;\nThe ODRs are directly inspired by the ADR and Software Testing approaches.\nSounds great, how do you start? Let\u0026rsquo;s be clear: no manager makes a decision for pleasure, we have to make decisions based on context, constraints, and/or requirements. The first step is to collect all of them!\nAt this point, we are not even considering options, finding solutions, or reducing the scope of the problem. We are creating the scoring matrix for future situations that might present themselves.\nSome definitions and examples will help to understand the nature of this trio!\nContext This makes up the undeniable facts.\nFor instance:\nX Key People left the company. The Senior Incredible Partner position has not been filled for Y months. Project CrazyShark has been stuck for Z months. Company A is merging with Company B. Constraints These define things that must be achieved, whether we like it or not.\nFor instance:\nSystem Pieceofshut needs to be maintained as it is the only available payment system. A law prevents the company to hire people outside their operating footprint. Security prevents external collaborators from bringing their own devices. Requirements This defines the ideal target state we want to reach. It is usually the main reason why we open a new Decision Record.\nFor instance:\nRelease a new product for YYYY/MM/DD. Teams from each company should be mixed. Engineering Manager John Doe has only 1 team to manage. Each team needs a Product Owner. Elements from these 3 categories make the decision drivers explicit, and they are used to score the considered options afterward.\nConsidered options Once the context, constraints, and requirements are exhaustively listed you can open the document to everyone in the company!\nThat will provide transparency, open the door for feedback, and let anyone interested contribute to the decision. This\u0026rsquo;ll explicitly say that the organization needs to make a decision and these are the factors that will drive the adopted solution.\nNow, you can start to list the options. At this point, we don\u0026rsquo;t want to reduce the scope or possibilities, we still want to be as exhaustive as we can.\nA mock example to help paint a picture:\nTeam A does not have a PO anymore:\nOption 1: Fire the whole team\nOption 2: Hire an external PO\nOption 2.1: Open a backfill position Option 2.2: Hire a contractor Option 3: Transfer an internal PO\nOption 3.1: Transfer John Doe from Team A Option 3.2: Transfer Jane Doe from Team B As you can see, you\u0026rsquo;ll consider all the available options, even the most extreme ones.\nThis process is open, and anyone in the company should be able to contribute, as it would prevent us from missing some options.\nDecision drivers, considered option, now what? Now it\u0026rsquo;s time for scoring!\nThis is quite an easy step, as it\u0026rsquo;s all about creating a table to include:\nOne column for each considered option. One line for each constraint. One line for each requirement. Then each cell is checked or not. When the case is fairly simple, the table is enough to elect an option as THE SOLUTION (which will be loved or hated). The most important action is to provide clarity and comprehensive reading on the decision.\nMore complex cases could lead to adding constraints and requirements or weighting them.\nFull Example Conclusion In summary, I love this decision-making framework as it really reminds me of the software testing mindset: defining first why you do things and what are the success criteria.\nAll the different options are then considered (even the terrible and extreme ones) to finally decide, by scoring the options using the success criteria.\nIt could be used for making any decision\u0026hellip; so maybe ADR: Any Decision Record would be a better name :)\n","permalink":"https://migibert.github.io/posts/odr-intro/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a manager, it is often really hard to make your process for making decisions crystal clear.
