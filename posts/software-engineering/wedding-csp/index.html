A wedding is a mix of family members, lifelong friends, and work colleagues, each with their own histories, relationships, and preferences. Some guests want to sit together, others should be kept apart, and family members often have priority seating near the married couple.\nA manually crafted seating chart can lead to compromises, overlooked conflicts, and unnecessary stress. Instead, we can turn to Constraint Programming (CP), a powerful approach that finds an optimal arrangement based on defined rules and preferences.\nDefining the Constraints A well-designed seating arrangement should balance social dynamics while respecting practical limitations. This repository shows a possible implementation.\nFamily Priorities The married couple should sit together (strongest affinity, 100). Parents should sit close to their child (50 affinity) and their child-in-law (25 affinity). Immediate family members (spouses, children) have a moderate affinity (10). Friendships and Social Preferences Friends with strong bonds have a preference to sit together (affinity values between 5 and 10). Work colleagues may prefer to sit together but not as strongly as family. Avoiding Conflicts Some guests have personal history or past disagreements, meaning they should be seated apart. We assign negative affinity values to these relationships, ensuring the solver tries to avoid placing them at the same table. Table Size Limits Each table has a fixed number of seats, meaning the solver must distribute guests while respecting capacity constraints. How Constraint Programming Helps Constraint Programming (CP) is a technique used to solve combinatorial problems where multiple constraints interact. Instead of trying every possible combination manually, we define rules, and the solver finds the best arrangement automatically.\nWe use Google OR-Tools, a powerful open-source solver, to:\nDefine Variables: Each guest is assigned a table. Apply Constraints: The solver ensures that each guest is at one table, that table capacities are not exceeded, and that affinity relationships are respected. Optimize the Seating: The solver maximizes positive affinities while minimizing conflicts. Why Use OR-Tools? OR-Tools is designed for complex decision-making problems like scheduling, resource allocation, and, in our case, wedding seating. Unlike brute-force approaches, which are computationally expensive, OR-Tools prunes impossible solutions early and finds near-optimal placements efficiently.\nWhat does it look like ? from ortools.sat.python import cp_model def solve_seating(guests, affinities, table_capacities): model = cp_model.CpModel() num_guests = len(guests) num_tables = len(table_capacities) # Create variables: guest assignments to tables table_vars = [model.NewIntVar(0, num_tables - 1, f'guest_{i}') for i in range(num_guests)] # Table capacity constraints for table in range(num_tables): model.Add(sum(table_vars[i] == table for i in range(num_guests)) \u003c= table_capacities[table]) # Affinity constraints: maximize overall affinity affinity_sum = sum( affinities[i][j] * (table_vars[i] == table_vars[j]) for i in range(num_guests) for j in range(i + 1, num_guests) ) model.Maximize(affinity_sum) # Solve model solver = cp_model.CpSolver() status = solver.Solve(model) if status == cp_model.OPTIMAL or status == cp_model.FEASIBLE: seating = {guests[i]: f'Table {solver.Value(table_vars[i])}' for i in range(num_guests)} return seating return \"No feasible seating arrangement found.\" Conclusion By using Constraint Programming, we can solve the wedding seating problem in a structured and optimized way. This approach eliminates the guesswork, ensures all constraints are considered, and produces a well-balanced seating arrangement that respects family ties, friendships, and social dynamics.\nWith this method, wedding planners (or engaged couples!) can focus on celebrating rather than stressing over seating charts.\n","wordCount":"548","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-03-28T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-03-28T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://migibert.github.io/posts/software-engineering/wedding-csp/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Mikaël Gibert","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://migibert.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://migibert.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Mikaël Gibert (Alt + H)">Mikaël Gibert</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
