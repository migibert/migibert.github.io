# Introduction

As a manager, I’ve found that the most effective way to drive change isn’t by pushing ideas onto my team, but by letting them take ownership. I like to call this approach **“inception”**, inspired by the movie of the same name. Instead of trying to convince people that my idea is the right one, I **seed it bit by bit, here and there, in discussions**, so that team members naturally adopt and advocate for it as their own.

## The Power of Context Sharing

A key element of this approach is **genuine context sharing**. I provide as much information as possible about company objectives, organizational changes, or internal policies. I usually follow a structured process:

1. **Start with context sharing**: I explain the situation, the constraints, and the opportunities.
2. **Analyze it on the fly and ask for feedback**: Together, we brainstorm potential issues and initial ideas.
3. **Let the discussion evolve over time**: Gathering feedback helps refine ideas organically.
4. **Shape the solution subtly**: Once the idea is solid enough, I don’t have to push for it. Instead, I can simply ask for an execution plan.

Bad ideas are naturally rejected because people aren’t stupid. If the right context is shared, weak ideas won’t gain traction publicly. The inception process **ensures that only the most relevant and viable ideas take root.**

## Real-World Examples of Inception in Action

Here are some real cases where I’ve successfully used this approach:

- **Scaling a team without breaking its capacity**: A team had hit its limit for the upcoming semester, yet company objectives required additional features to generate revenue. Instead of challenging their bandwidth, I shared the financial context and competing priorities. Through discussions, we explored solutions and landed on a **contribution model**, onboarding developers from other teams with minimal disruption.
- **Transferring a developer between teams**: Instead of imposing the decision, I gradually surfaced the idea in conversations until the affected teams and the concerned individual saw the value in it and started the process by themselves.
- **Adopting English as the standard language**: After multiple international acquisitions, we needed a unified communication standard. By sharing the long-term benefits and letting discussions unfold, the transition happened smoothly.
- **Standardizing Decision Records in a remote-first, culturally diverse company**: A structured approach to documenting decisions emerged as the best way to align teams across different backgrounds.

## Empathy and the Art of Detecting Weak Signals

One challenge of inception is that **people don’t always voice their doubts openly**, especially to their manager. Some may hesitate to challenge an idea directly, while others might disengage rather than push back.

That’s why **empathy and active listening** are critical. Instead of assuming silence means agreement, I pay attention to **weak signals**:

- **Body language and tone**: Do people seem hesitant, or are they unusually quiet?
- **Indirect comments**: Are concerns surfacing in casual conversations but not in formal discussions?
- **Engagement levels**: Are some team members withdrawing rather than contributing?

By picking up on these cues, I can create space for deeper conversations. Sometimes, just asking *"What’s your biggest concern about this?"* surfaces unspoken feedback and leads to a much better solution.

I also deeply use **self-criticism** by publicly exposing the drawbacks I can imagine so that people can go further and expose their own doubts.

## When Inception Isn’t Enough: Making Hard Decisions Transparent

While inception works well for many changes, some decisions simply **can’t** be left open for debate. For instance, after a merger, different teams might be using different programming languages or even different working language. Allowing an endless discussion on which language to standardize on could **paralyze progress**.

In such cases, I rely on **Organizational Decision Records (ODRs)** to document and communicate the decision clearly. An ODR explains:

- **Context**: Why was this decision necessary?
- **Constraints**: What are the soft and hard constraints we have to compose with?
- **Requirements**: What are we trying to maximize / minimize
- **Considered Options**: What alternatives were explored, and why were they not chosen?
- **Decision**: What was chosen and why?

This does not mean everyone will agree but it ensures they understandand do not feel blindsided or ignored. By documenting the reasoning, the decision becomes **disputable yet legitimate**, reducing frustration and misalignment.

## Conclusion

Inception isn’t about manipulation, it’s about **facilitating natural adoption**. By sharing context, fostering discussions, and refining ideas over time, managers can encourage their teams to take ownership of the best solutions. And when decisions need to be made firmly, transparency through ODRs ensures alignment, even in disagreement.

At the core of this approach lies **empathy, openness, and trust**. If we expose the problems clearly, listen carefully, remain open to feedback, and detect weak signals, we can guide our teams toward **better, self-driven outcomes.**
